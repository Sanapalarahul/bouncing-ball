Defining the Game Concept
Game Concept and Mechanics
Let's break down the core concepts and mechanics you'll be implementing.

Platform Control:

Objective: Use arrow keys to move the platform left or right.

Implementation: Your platform moves horizontally based on key input.

Limitations: Ensure the platform stays within the screen boundaries.
Bouncing Ball Dynamics:

Objective: Guide the bouncing ball across the screen.
Implementation: The ball moves independently, bouncing off walls and the platform.
Interaction: Score points each time the ball successfully bounces off the platform.
Scoring System:

Objective: Accumulate points based on successful bounces.
Implementation: Your coding determines the scoring system.
Challenge: Optimize the scoring mechanism for higher scores.
Level Progression:

Objective: Advance through levels as your score reaches milestones.
Implementation: With every 10 points, you progress to a new level.
Challenge: Expect increased difficulty and complexity with each level.
Dynamic Platform Color:

Objective: Platform color changes with each level, adding a visual dynamic.
Implementation: Colors are randomly generated upon reaching a new level.
Aesthetic Touch: Adds variety and excitement to the gaming experience.
Lives and Game Over:

Objective: Avoid letting the ball fall off the screen to maintain lives.
Implementation: Lives decrease with missed bounces. Game over occurs when lives run out (you have only 3 lives).
Restart: After game over, restart with three lives and a fresh score.
