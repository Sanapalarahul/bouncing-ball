Defining the Game Concept
Game Concept and Mechanics
Let's break down the core concepts and mechanics we will be implementing.

Platform Control:

Objective: Used arrow keys to move the platform left or right.

Implementation: our platform moves horizontally based on key input.


Bouncing Ball Dynamics:

Objective:to  Guide the bouncing ball across the screen.

Implementation: The ball moves independently, bouncing off walls and the platform.

Interaction: Score points each time the ball successfully bounces off the platform.
Scoring System:

Objective: Accumulate points based on successful bounces.

Implementation: Your coding determines the scoring system.

Challenge: Optimize the scoring mechanism for higher scores.
Level Progression:

Objective: Advance through levels as your score reaches milestones.

Implementation: With every 10 points, you progress to a new level.

Challenge: Expect increased difficulty and complexity with each level.

Dynamic Platform Color:

Objective: Platform color changes with each level, adding a visual dynamic.

Implementation: Colors are randomly generated upon reaching a new level.

Aesthetic Touch: Adds variety and excitement to the gaming experience.
Lives and Game Over:

Objective: to Avoid letting the ball fall off the screen to maintain lives.

Implementation: Lives decrease with missed bounces. Game over occurs when lives run out (we have only 3 lives).

Restart: After game over, restart with three lives and a fresh score.
